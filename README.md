pyhermes
========

A python-based (no IRAF) data reduction tool for the HERMES instrument,
created due to delays and issues with an effective 2dFDR/IRAF reduction. 
Note that the IRAF and 2dFDR pipeline are now (as of late-2015) more 
fully-featured than pyhermes and are operating more or less reliably on the
data. pyhermes should still be the software of choice for precision 
radial velocity implementatinos for HERMES - contact Mike Ireland for
details.
